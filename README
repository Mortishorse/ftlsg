Version: 0.1
Author: Vegard Haugland <vegard@haugland.at>

Info:
-----

This application allows you to edit certain variables in the FTL savegame file
(continue.sav). At the moment, it is limited to modifying:

 - Scrap
 - Ship Integrity
 - Fuel
 - Missiles
 - Droids 

Usage:
------

 1. Run it! (./ftlsg continue.sav)
 2. [ do something]
 3. Modified savegame is stored as output.sav

Future work:
------------

Approximately 1/3 of the savegame is being parsed as of this version. Future
work involves:

 - Parsing (and decoding) 100% of the savegame.
 - Allowing you to change more variables.
 - Allowing you to make modifications to your profile.
